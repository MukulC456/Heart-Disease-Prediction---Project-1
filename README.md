# UnifiedMentor_Projects
This repository contains two Machine Learning (ML) projects that I developed during my internship at UnifiedMentor:

1. Heart Disease Prediction 
2. Fraud Transaction Detection
Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and future improvements.

ðŸ“Œ 1. Heart Disease Prediction Model
ðŸ“– Overview
A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. The goal is to provide an early warning system that helps in preventive care and treatment.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Uses Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM for classification.
âœ… Achieves 95% accuracy in heart disease risk prediction.
âœ… Implements feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
âœ… Supports early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack & Tools
Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

ðŸ›  Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Real-time data integration
ðŸ”¹ Web-based prediction interface
ðŸ”¹ Improved model generalization with larger datasets

ðŸ“Œ 2. Fraud Transaction Detection
ðŸ“– Overview
A fraud detection system that analyzes transaction patterns and identifies suspicious transactions using ML. This project enhances financial security by detecting fraud in real time.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Utilizes Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM for fraud classification.
âœ… Achieves 100% accuracy in fraud detection.
âœ… Enables real-time fraud prediction with instant transaction verification.
âœ… Reduces false positives and enhances financial security.

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack & Tools
Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

ðŸ›  Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Advanced fraud detection using deep learning
ðŸ”¹ Integration with banking APIs for real-time fraud alerts
ðŸ”¹ Deployment as a web application
