# Heart Disease Risk Prediction Model

# Overview
A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. The goal is to provide an early warning system that helps in preventive care and treatment.

# Key Features
1. Uses Random Forest for classification.
2. Achieves 95% accuracy in heart disease risk prediction.
3. Implements feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
4. Supports early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

# Tech Stack & Tools
1. Programming: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. ML Algorithms: Random Forest

# Future Enhancements
1. Real-time data integration
2. Web-based prediction interface
3. Improved model generalization with larger datasets
